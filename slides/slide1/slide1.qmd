## Overview 

- This presentation is designed as one of the first sessions for a series of workshops on empirical economics for non-economists.

[Today's goal]{.alert}

- Briefly review what empirical economics is and some key concepts.
- Provide some examples of empirical research.
- Provide some technical jargons used in empirical economics.
- [Caution]{.alert}: I am not an expert. My definition and explanation may not be 100% accurate.

## Acknowledgments

- Many concepts and definitions are borrowed from Phil haile's slide on **Models, measurement, and the language of economics**.
- Think of this as a concise, easier version of it.

## (Brief) What is empirical economics?

- Essentially, any research that involves using real-world data. 
- More formally, using data and economic models to identify and understand certain phenomena in the real world.
- While topics of empirical econmics are vast, its power lies in (mostly) coherent set of tools and tehcniques to understand topics of interest.
- Due to its flexibility, tools and methods from empirical economics are widely used in other fields, such as psychology, sociology, political science, etc.

## Example: legalized abortion and crime

## Types of empirical work

While taxonomy can vary, we can broadly categorize empirical work into three types: [descriptive (correlation) and structural (causation).]{.alert}

## Descriptive

[Descriptive empirical work]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"} refers to studies that describe the relationship between observed variables.

- Example: 
  - income is correlated with education level.
  - crime rate is correlated with poverty rate.
  - immigration is correlated with crime rate.

Usually a great starting point for empirical research.

## But correlation is not causation!

![](cage.jpeg)

- Many real world observations are correlated, but not always causally related.

## But that is obvious!

- Certain correlations can appear highly convincing as evidence of causality, but they are not.
- Example: In many films and TV shows, it often seems that more attractive actors are not as strong in their acting abilities.
- Maybe in general, there is a negative relationship between attractiveness and acting abilities?

## Collider bias

- Suppose actually there was no correlation.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Generate 1000 random values from 0 to 6 for talent and appearance
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
talent <- runif(1000, 0, 6)
appearance <- runif(1000, 0, 6)

# Create data frame
actor_data <- data.frame(talent = talent, appearance = appearance)

# Calculate correlation
correlation <- cor(actor_data$talent, actor_data$appearance)

# Create ggplot
ggplot(data = actor_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = talent, y = appearance), 
             alpha = 0.6, color = "steelblue") +
  # Add correlation text
  annotate("text", x = 5.5, y = 5.5, 
           label = paste("Correlation =", round(correlation, 3)), 
           size = 4, color = "darkblue", fontface = "bold") +
  labs(x = "Talent", y = "Appearance", 
       title = "Relationship between Talent and Appearance") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Collider bias

- In order to be an actor, one needs to be above some threshold that is comibnation of talent and appearance.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Generate 1000 random values from 0 to 6 for talent and appearance
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
talent <- runif(1000, 0, 6)
appearance <- runif(1000, 0, 6)

# Create data frame
actor_data <- data.frame(talent = talent, appearance = appearance)

# Create ggplot
ggplot(data = actor_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = talent, y = appearance), 
             alpha = 0.6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 6, slope = -1, color = "red", size = 1) +
  geom_point(data = actor_data[actor_data$talent + actor_data$appearance < 6, ], 
             mapping = aes(x = talent, y = appearance), 
             alpha = 0.6, color = "gray") +
  labs(x = "Talent", y = "Appearance", 
       title = "Relationship between Talent and Appearance") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Collider bias

- Now get a correlation between talent and appearance only from points above the threshold.
- It became -0.5!

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Generate 1000 random values from 0 to 6 for talent and appearance
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
talent <- runif(1000, 0, 6)
appearance <- runif(1000, 0, 6)

# Create data frame
actor_data <- data.frame(talent = talent, appearance = appearance)

# Filter for blue dots (above threshold)
blue_dots <- actor_data[actor_data$talent + actor_data$appearance >= 6, ]

# Calculate correlation for blue dots
correlation <- cor(blue_dots$talent, blue_dots$appearance)

# Create ggplot
ggplot(data = actor_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = talent, y = appearance), 
             alpha = 0.6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 6, slope = -1, color = "red", size = 1) +
  geom_point(data = actor_data[actor_data$talent + actor_data$appearance < 6, ], 
             mapping = aes(x = talent, y = appearance), 
             alpha = 0.6, color = "gray") +
  # Add linear model line for blue dots
  geom_smooth(data = blue_dots, 
              mapping = aes(x = talent, y = appearance), 
              method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkblue", size = 1) +
  # Add correlation text
  annotate("text", x = 5.5, y = 5.5, 
           label = paste("Correlation =", round(correlation, 3)), 
           size = 4, color = "darkblue", fontface = "bold") +
  labs(x = "Talent", y = "Appearance", 
       title = "Relationship between Talent and Appearance") +
  theme_bw()
```


## Structural and (structural) models

[Structural empirical work]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"} aims to quantify certain features of the assumed data generating process (DGP, i.e. structure).

- These features are usually implied to have causal interpretation.
- Example: estimate demand for schools, demand for education, etc.
- This is now more than just a statistical model. We are imposing certain assumptions (or structures) on the way data is generated. 
- From now on, we will use the term "structural model" to refer to this type of model that characterizes the underlying true structure of the data generating process.

## Causal inference and counterfactuals

What is causal inference or causal effect?

- Simply put, it is the effect of a change in one variable on another variable (but nothing else).
- This induces the term [counterfactuals]{.alert}. Holding other things fixed means we need to consider what would have happened if the other things were different.
- This parallel world notion of things is called [counterfactual]{.alert}.

## Example: UPenn admissions and job market outcomes

- Your research question: Does getting into Penn graduate school (X) increase your job market outcomes (Y)? ~~(We surely hope so!)~~

![](dag1.png)

- In application, you would run some regression like: $Y = \alpha + \beta X + \epsilon$.
- But will this work? Will the estimate we get be the parameter that we want to get?

## Example: UPenn admissions and job market outcomes

- It might actually not be the effect of Penn but just that more talented students are more likely to get into Penn and more likely to have better job market outcomes.

![](dag2.png)

- In order to exactly estimate the CAUSAL effect of Penn admissions on job market outcomes, we need a way to shut down the effect of talent (Z).

## Identification

- [Identification]{.alert} is also a term used a lot in empirical economics.
- It is also related to what we just talked about.
- Roughly speaking, identification is the process of finding a way to retrieve the (unique) causal effect of interest from the observed data.
- So in the previous slide, people would say "we want to find a way to identify the causal effect of Penn admissions on job market outcomes".

## Ideal case? Randomized controlled trial (RCT)

- Easiest way to identify the causal effect of interest is to run a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- Simple in theory since we can randomly assign the treatment (Penn admissions) to the subjects.
- But in practice, it is often difficult to implement (randomly assigning Penn admissions is not feasible).

## Quasi-experiments?/natural experiments?

- Not ideal, but sometimes we can use certain real world intervention that acted as if random to identify the causal effect of interest.
- Example: Effect of natural disasters on economic activity.
- Example: Staggered adoption of governmental policies.
- Recent popularity of causal inference is largely due to the researcher's clever use of quasi-experiments to identify causal effects.

## Reduced-form approach

- We need to assume some structure and model to say anything about the causal effect of interest.
- But how we impose the model have some leeway.
- Complicated model might be imposing too much assumptions on the data generating process.
- Reduced-form approach is a broad umbrella term for model that does not impose strong functional forms on the model and focus on the use of quasi-experiments or natural experiments to identify causal effects.

## Structural approach

- You will also hear (especially in Econ.) some people say they do "structrual"/"structual model" as opposed to "reduced-form".
- The term "structure" here refers to a different conceptual layer than the structural model we talked about earlier (reduced-form is also structural in terms of the previous definition).
- In general, this just mostly means opposite of "reduced-form". You have a more complex model or are estimating some sort of "primitive" parameters of interest.
- Personally, I think this is a bit of a misnomer.

## Conclusion

How are these useful for non-economists?

- Social scientists: Tools used in empirical economics are relatively topic-agnostic. Could be a nice tools to apply to your own research.
- Non-social scientists: Notion of causal inference provides valuable perspective on how to think about the world.
